        <h1>The Touch of the Master's Hand</h1>
    </header>

    <p><em>Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer Thought it scarcely worth his while To waste much time on the old violin, But held it up with a smile:</em></p>
    <p><em>“What am I bidden, good folks,” he cried, “Who’ll start the bidding for me?” “A dollar, a dollar”; then, “Two!” “Only two? Two dollars, and who’ll make it three?</em></p>
    <p><em>Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice; Going for three—” But no, From the room, far back, a gray-haired man Came forward and picked up the bow;</em></p>
            <p><em>Then, wiping the dust from the old violin, And tightening the loose strings, He played a melody pure and sweet As a caroling angel sings.</em></p>
    <p><em>The music ceased, and the auctioneer, With a voice that was quiet and low, Said, “What am I bid for the old violin?” And he held it up with the bow.
        <p><em>“A thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two? Two thousand! And who’ll make it three? Three thousand, once, three thousand, twice, And going, and gone!” said he.</em></p>
            <p><em>The people cheered, but some of them cried, “We do not quite understand What changed its worth.” Swift came the reply: “The touch of a master’s hand.”</em></p>
        <p><em>And many a man with life out of tune, And battered and scarred with sin, Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd, Much like the old violin.</em></p>
        <p><em>A “mess of pottage,” a glass of wine, A game—and he travels on. He’s “going” once, and “going” twice, He’s “going” and almost “gone.”</em></p>
        <p><em>But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd Never can quite understand</em></p>
        <p><em>The worth of a soul and the change that’s wrought By the touch of the Master’s hand.</em></p>
