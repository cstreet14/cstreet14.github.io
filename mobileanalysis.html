        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>I had the opportunity to look at websites from a perspective that I don't normally view them in. For 24 hours I used my cell phone to look at a few different websites to help myself better realize and understand how much more interactive and user-friendly an individual's experience is on a computer or PC as opposed to their mobile device. As you continue scrolling down, you will be able to read some of the insights I gained during this experience.</p>

        <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
            <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
            <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
            <li>Any frustrations?</li>
            <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Findings</h2>

        <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>

        <p>As is the case with any website that you are looking at on a mobile device, you're not going to see everything on there that you would find if you were using Google Chrome or just a computer in general due to the limited amount of space on the screen. However, for a few of these sites, like NFL.com for example, I was able to see almost everything that you would see if you had used a computer. So overall, it really came down to the number of ads that were displayed on each of these particular sites as well as the number of links that were provided in the navigation bar at the top of the page.</p>

        <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>

        <p>Overall, I would say that I was able to find what I was looking for on each of these different sites. For almost all of them, I would sometimes be required to make a few more clicks in order to get to where I was hoping to go than I would if I had just been using a computer, but for the most part it wasn't too much of a hassle for me.</p>

        <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>

        <p>This question is pretty closely related to the first two. Generally speaking, I was able to do what I had intended to do when I got on to each of these sites. Again, there were a few inconveniences that resulted from there not being as much space on the screen as there is on a computer, but I was able to live with it and felt like I had productive visits to each of these websites.</p>

        <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>

        <p>There's no doubt that there were frustrations! Whenever you're used to visiting websites on a conputer versus a mobile device, as most of us probably are, it can get a bit frustrating to have to deal with such a smaller screen. And since this is the case for me, I already have a good idea as to what I should see displayed when I visit certain sites. So I think the main thing was just that I knew that there were certain aspects of the website that weren't being displayed due to the lack of space available on the screen. And in addition to that, because there were certain things that weren't being shown on the homepage, you had to do a little bit of searching for them. On Facebook, there are certain abilities that you're not able to access both on the app or on the website on your cell phone because of the overall change in display on a mobile device, which abilities you do have on a computer. So really, it's not that big of a deal, but there's no question that there are differences in experience and, therefore, frustrations as a result of the change in size of the display screen.</p>

        <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>

        <p>I must admit that it is pretty nice to not have as many distractions when you're using a mobile device as opposed to a PC or computer. On Facebook, for example, there are so many things that are shown on my news feed page that it makes me feel like I'm about to lose it! Sometimes it almost feels overwhelming and a little too busy, which isn't very helpful for a lot of people, perhaps myself included, when trying to find out and learn new things. So having a smaller screen definitely helps to eliminate some of that. But I think that that could be said about almost any website that exists. I would say that this is the most obvious advantage of using a smaller screen in this regard.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>What did you learn? Where there any surprises? Most of what I learned was more about myself than anythign else. i learned that I need to be more patient when having to use smaller devices to access any website or to do anything technologically related. I'm grateful for having had this experience because it has reminded me of how I need to appreciate everything that the Lord has given us, including the smaller pieces of technology. Each one is a miracle and should never be taken for granted.</p>
