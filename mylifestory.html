        <h1>"Story of My Life!"</h1>
        <p>Greetings everyone! My name is Casey Streeter. I am the youngest of seven children and was born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina. As a young student, I attended Claxton Elementary and Kernodle Middle School, as well as Caldwell Academy for my four years of high school. During my childhood, my family and I only ever moved once, and it was only five minutes down the road from where we currently live! My greatest hobby and favorite thing to do is to play sports and go to sporting events. I love to play football and basketball particularly, and have played them throughout my life. I come from a huge football family: my cousin, <a href="http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=209802571">Brandon</a>, is the quarterbacks coach at Clemson University, and my uncle, <a href="http://gettysburgsports.com/coaches.aspx?rc=970&path=football">Barry</a>, is the head football coach at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. Needless to say, we were a happy bunch this past January when Clemson won the 2016 National Championship!</p>
        <p>I served as a full-time missionary in the Idaho Boise and Idaho Nampa Missions from May 2012-May 2014. My life has been permanently changed as a result of these most wonderful two years. I love the people of Idaho so much and am so grateful for the opportunity I have of being able to attend college in this great state as well! I began attending BYU-Idaho in January 2015 and am currently in my sixth semester here. Even so, it wasn't until last semester that I was finally able to figure out what I would be majoring in, which is Computer Information Technology. Perhaps only the Lord knows why it has taken as long as it has, but I'm grateful for the experiences that I have had which have led me to where I am now. I am excited to see what lies ahead, or in other words, to find out more about the word on the street!</p>
